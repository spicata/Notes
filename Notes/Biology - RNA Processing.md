**tldr:** Transcribed mRNA is spliced of all the useless bits to produce "mature" mRNA.
**also see:** [[Biology - Transcription]]

## Notes
Genes = DNA segment coding -> a protein
Coding DNA = Exon
Non-coding DNA = Intron
During transcription, introns need - be removed through RNA splicing
DNA -> Primary transcript -> Mature transcript -> Protein
Primary transcript = snippet x . 1 gene (Transcripition).
Mature transcript = primary transcript w!/ introns (Splicing).
RNA splicing allows 1 gene - encode -> >1 protein by snipping out certain parts.

Goes in 5' - 3' direction
On 5' side, 5' cap = added
5' cap = modified guanosine triphosphate

## Cues
How do enzymes know what is introns and what is exons?
If 1 gene can code for >1 protein, how do enzymes know what exons to cut out?
How do enzymes know where one gene begins and another one ends? [[Biology - Promoters & Terminators]]
